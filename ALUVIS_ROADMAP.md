# ALUVIS Roadmap

Conventional commits pushed to `origin/main`, one validated milestone at a
time. Every milestone gate: `flutter analyze` clean, focused tests, full
suite green, diff inspected, then commit + push + this file updated.

## Completed milestones

| Milestone | Commit | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| Repo audit → editor architecture refactor | bfca089 | analyze clean, suite green at the time |
| Construction width/height ID fix | 9f8a38a | analyze clean, suite green |
| Hermetic editor tests (DI `_StubCatalogStore`, rename to `construction_editor_screen_test.dart`) | a7a05e6, 525f6be, c8c23af | suite unblocked standalone |
| EditorViewport foundation (single uniform transform) | 26a9b67 | viewport unit tests |
| Canvas integration of live viewport | 360edde | screen tests |
| Undo / redo | 8551576 | controller + widget tests |
| Model-space snapping foundation | c67eafc | snap engine tests |
| Narrow-section paint crash fix | 25a6cbe | painter regression tests |
| Boundary-move geometry/controller | 9cc683c | boundary_manipulation tests |
| Boundary drag interaction | 13af9c3 | integration tests |
| Canvas containment fix + dark palette (superseded visually by workshop grid milestone; clip/repaint fixes retained) | e913633 | pixel-verified containment, 244 tests |
| **M1 Workshop drafting: pure drafting-grid math** (`selectMinorGridInterval` 1-2-5 adaptive selection, `gridLinesForRange` origin-aligned visible-line enumeration) | b224512 | analyze clean; drafting_grid_test 15/15; full suite 259/259 |

Suite size history: 119 → 242 (through boundary drag) → 244 (containment fix)
→ **259** (after M1).

## In progress

Workshop Drafting Grid + Configurable Snapping + Precision Dimensions:

- [x] M1 `feat(editor): add pure drafting-grid math` — b224512
- [x] M2 `feat(snap): configurable snap sources and priority` — f7a22da
      (SnapTargetKind.grid, SnapConfig, snapToGrid, resolveSnapPosition;
      legacy geometry-only behavior preserved; suite 275)
- [x] M3 `feat(editor): per-editor drafting settings with toolbar controls` —
      6d134e8 (EditorDraftingSettings ChangeNotifier, screen-owned; 'Aimanter'
      + 'Afficher la grille' toolbar toggles; settings listener wiring caught
      by tests; suite 279. Increment picker DEFERRED to M5 per no-inert-UI
      rule.)
- [x] M4 `feat(editor): workshop grid rendering and light canvas palette` —
      bc3bc9d (painter showGrid layer via M1 math under geometry; off-white
      ground 0xFFFAFBFC; light-tuned palette; pixel-sampled verification
      harness run then deleted; suite 283).
- [ ] M5 `feat(editor): grid-aware boundary snapping` — drag consumes
      resolver; dashed-vs-solid ActiveSnap distinction; snap ON/OFF +
      increments end-to-end; one-drag-one-undo preserved.
- [ ] M6 precision-dimension validation/improvements — exact numeric editing,
      parsing/invalid-input verification, undo/staleness coverage; canvas-label
      direct editing only if it fits naturally (else documented future task).

## Decisions on record

- Grid/snap-increment are interaction aids, NOT fabrication rules; never fed
  into calculator inputs or persisted Construction JSON.
- Drafting settings are editor-session state (no persistence architecture
  exists; smallest sensible scope).
- Snap priority: nearest model distance wins; exact tie geometry > grid;
  two-way geometry tie -> lower position (existing convention).
- Major grid line = every 5th minor across the whole 1-2-5 series.
- Tolerance stays screen-perceived (`kSnapTolerancePx / scale`); increment is
  pure model-space mm.

## Current next milestone

M5 — grid-aware boundary snapping: drag consumes resolveSnapPosition with
session settings; dashed-vs-solid ActiveSnap distinction; snap ON/OFF and
increments end-to-end (increment picker ships HERE, completing the
no-inert-UI rule); existing boundary test updated to disable snap
explicitly.
